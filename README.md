# Oppo-clone
I created a static website clone of the Oppo official site using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The project features a responsive design, a functional navigation bar, a product display section, an image slider, and a detailed footer. The clone aims to enhance web development skills and closely mirrors the original site's design and layout.
